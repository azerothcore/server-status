# AzerothCore Server Status

This is a simple web application built with Angular2+ and Bootstrap to show the online players list of a AzerothCore server.

It is based on the [AzerothAPI](https://github.com/AzerothJS/AzerothAPI).

### Installation

The application require the [AzerothAPI](https://github.com/AzerothJS/AzerothAPI) to access to the characters database.

Clone the Server-Status folder inside your web server directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/azerothcore/server-status.git
```
Then copy the file `config.ts.dist` to `config.ts`, open it and set properly with the path of the API and the server name.

### ðŸŽ¨ Theme Management (New Feature)

This project now supports **multiple visual themes**.

#### How to select a theme:
1. Open the file: `src/styles.scss`
2. Uncomment the `@use` line corresponding to the theme you want to activate.
3. Ensure all other themes are commented out.

##### Example:
```scss
// @use 'theme-legacy';
@use 'theme-azeroth';
```

âœ… Note: Only one theme should be active at a time.
This manual selection keeps things simple and avoids unnecessary complexity.

You can fully customize styles by editing the corresponding theme files in src/styles/.
